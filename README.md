# Lexical Analysis of Gradation Strategies in Brazilian Portuguese

## Context

This repository brings the scripts used for lexical analysis of Brazilian Portuguese YouTube comments we wrote for our paper:

> Lima-Lopes, R. E. de and Arruda, C. P. S. (2020) Strategies for Gradation in YouTube comments. (under review)

Soon as we have it published, a link for the paper will be posted here.

Each script brings a different research step:

1. Data scrape
1. Wordlist and concordancing
1. Correlation
4. Plotting

Unfortunately, we cannot make raw data available, but a table with our final results is here in CSV format.

Please, drop us a line if you have any doubt:
