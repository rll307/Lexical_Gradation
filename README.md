# Lexical Analysis of Gradation Strategies in Brazilian Portuguese

## Context

This repository brings the scripts used for lexical analysis of Brazilian Portuguese YouTube comments we wrote for our paper:

> Lima-Lopes, R. E. de and Arruda, C. P. S. (2020) Strategies for Gradation in YouTube comments. (under review)

Soon as we have it published, a link for the paper will be posted here.

Each script brings a different research step:

1.  Data scraping
2.  Wordlist and concordancing
3.  Correlation
4.  Plotting

Unfortunately, we cannot make raw data available, but a table with our final results is here in CSV format.

This script was developed for the analysis of Portuguese. We hope it helps colleagues in the LC area and popularise the use of R. It is part of our research project developed with CNPQ. Please drop us a line if you have any doubts or need any help.

Please, drop us a line if you have any doubt:
